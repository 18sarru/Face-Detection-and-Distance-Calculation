# Face-Detection-and-Distance-Calculation
A project on javascript which detects a face in a live video and calculates the distance of the face from the web camera.

Face detection has always been a challenging task in computer vision literature. We need
to determine if there are any faces in a given input image and, if present, return the image
location and extent of each face. While this appears to be a trivial task for human beings,
it is a very challenging task for computers. We use the Viola and Jones face detection
algorithm as it is the best possible face detection algorithm with a very high detection
rate.

Along with the face detection, we are also calculating the distance of the face in
proportion to the frame, figuring out if the face is too far away or too close.
